Welcome to this project.

To start the project, put the two files together into a directory of public html folder (/var/www/ or something else) with back-end support for local data storage
Use a browser i.e. Google Chrome. It is required for you to install an extension that override the CORS. 
Extension: https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/allow-control-allow-origi/nlfbmbojpeacfghkpbjhddihlkkiljbi?hl=en
Otherwise, the CORS issue will pop up. If you decided to avoid my suggested method. You are responsibility for making CORS to function properly
